# SkeletonKey
Skeleton key is a basal key type used across all libraries maintained by Breach Dogs. These keys must be generated in consistent ways, and are used across almost every ECS-like component we have made. Ultimately, it was the emergence of the need for an up-projection into the concept of an actor for the purposes of assigning abilities and attributes to non-actors that drove the creation of ObjectKey, and with it, the defactoring of the Key Types
